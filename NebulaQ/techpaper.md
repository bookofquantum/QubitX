Its architecture supports error mitigation techniques, high-speed optical processing, and reconfigurable quantum gates, making it suitable for applications in quantum simulation, machine learning, and secure communications. NebulaQ’s modular design allows for expansion beyond ten qubits, enabling scalable implementations for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper presents the theoretical framework, hardware design, and experimental performance benchmarks of NebulaQ, highlighting its role in advancing the next generation of photonic quantum processors.

1. Introduction

1.1 Background & Motivation

Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative technology, promising solutions to computational problems that are infeasible for classical systems. Existing quantum computing platforms, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and neutral atoms, face challenges related to scalability, coherence times, and error correction overheads.

Photonic quantum processors present an attractive alternative by leveraging the quantum properties of light. Unlike discrete-variable (DV) systems, which encode quantum information in two-level systems, continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing exploits squeezed light states and Gaussian transformations, facilitating high-dimensional entanglement and fault-tolerant computation.

NebulaQ is a ten-qubit photonic quantum processor built upon squeezed vacuum states, two-mode entanglement, and programmable unitary transformations (SU(5)). With an integrated photonic architecture supporting high-efficiency photon-number-resolving (PNR) detection, NebulaQ delivers precision quantum state manipulation and measurement, offering a pathway to scalable and practical quantum computing.
