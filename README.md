# QubitX

Abstract

QubitX is a cutting-edge hybrid photonic quantum computer designed to push the boundaries of computational power, efficiency, and accessibility. Combining photonic qubits with traditional electronic control systems, QubitX leverages the advantages of light-speed information processing, low thermal noise, and scalability to deliver a robust quantum computing solution.

At its core, QubitX features a ten-qubit photonic processor, integrated with a high-precision fiber-optic communication system for enhanced coherence and minimal decoherence effects. By utilizing a hybrid approach, QubitX bridges the gap between classical and quantum computing, allowing seamless interfacing with existing computational architectures. The external power supply ensures stable operation, while the use of FR4 material enables cost-effective fabrication and broad adoption.

QubitX represents a significant step toward practical quantum computing, offering researchers, developers, and enterprises a powerful platform to explore quantum algorithms, cryptographic advancements, and complex problem-solving applications. Its modular design and scalability make it a pioneering innovation in the field, setting the stage for the next generation of quantum-enhanced computing.
