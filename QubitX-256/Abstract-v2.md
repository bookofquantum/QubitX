# **Abstract**  

The **QubitX-256** is a 256-qubit **photonic quantum processor** designed for scalable, high-speed quantum computation. It leverages **dual-rail photonic qubits**, **on-chip quantum gates**, and **real-time quantum error correction** to enable robust quantum operations. The architecture integrates **silicon-on-insulator (SOI), TriPleX, or Hydex waveguides**, ensuring low-loss optical signal propagation while maintaining coherence. Quantum logic is controlled via an **FPGA-based system**, with **electro-optic and thermo-optic phase shifters** enabling fast, precise gate operations. High-fidelity quantum measurement is achieved through **superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs)**, while **optical parametric amplifiers (OPA)** enhance coherence. External connectivity is provided via **fiber-optic I/O, PCIe Gen 5, and Optical Ethernet**, enabling seamless integration with classical computing systems. This paper explores the fabrication feasibility of the **QubitX-256**, addressing challenges in waveguide design, coupling efficiency, error correction, and thermal stability, with a focus on optimizing manufacturability for scalable quantum computing solutions.
