Some next steps to refine the design could include:
	•	Fabrication Feasibility: Identifying semiconductor foundries or photonic chip manufacturers capable of producing the SOI-based waveguide system with integrated phase shifters and beam splitters.
	•	Cryogenic vs. Room-Temperature Design Trade-offs: SNSPDs require cryogenics, while alternative detection schemes (e.g., avalanche photodiodes) could allow room-temperature operation.
	•	Error Correction Implementation: Defining the surface code layout and integration into the FPGA for real-time syndrome decoding.
	•	Laser Stabilization & Noise Suppression: Selecting pump sources and noise-filtering techniques to ensure coherence amplification (QBoost) functions optimally.
