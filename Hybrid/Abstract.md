**Abstract**

This paper presents the design and implementation of a hybrid quantum computer integrating photonic qubits within the classical computing framework. Utilizing the principles of photonic transistors, this novel architecture enables three computing modes—classical, hybrid, and quantum—to function concurrently. The cornerstone of this design is the Quantum Photonic Engine, a photonic qubit device that serves as both a transistor and a superposition provider. The Quantum Photonic Engine not only facilitates classical computation but also measures the quantum properties of additional pulsed photons in real-time, thereby bridging the gap between classical and quantum paradigms. This dual functionality significantly reduces the physical space required for hybrid quantum computing systems and enhances computational efficiency. The potential applications span across various fields, including cryptography, machine learning, and complex system simulations, underscoring the transformative impact of this innovative approach on the future of computing.
